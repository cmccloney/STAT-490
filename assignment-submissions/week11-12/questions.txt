1. Could you elaborate on the mechanics behind the process of cost complexity pruning from algorithm 8.1?

2. Will the Gini index or entropy still function well if the proportions are constant for every split, but not near one or zero?

3. Can you break down the terms in equation 8.9?

4. Why and how does each bagged tree only use about 2/3 of the observations?

5. Why is the OOB error equivalent to the LOOCV error?

6. Can you elaborate on the idea behind measuring variable importance in bagging (p. 319)?

7. Can you provide an example of interpreting a model created using boosting, with d = 1?

8. Is it possible to combine random forests and boosting to build a model?
