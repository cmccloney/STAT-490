1. The book states that k-fold CV is more accurate than LOOCV. Why is that? How would you determine the value of k for which k-fold CV is the most accurate?
2. What if you calculated the test MSE for every possible layout of k-fold CV, if this were computationally feasible would it improve the accuracy or precision and if so, by how much?
  What I mean is, if n = 4, and you do 2-fold CV, you would need to repeat the 2-fold CV process 2 times, once for every group of k=2 you could form.
3. Which approach is the best cross validation approach and why?
4. For bootstrapping, if computational power and time weren't issues, how accurate and precise could bootstrapping potentially be?
5. For QDA in chapter 4, could you explain the relationship between the formulas the book gives for QDA and Bayes Theorem?
6. I forgot to ask, from your paper, you said beta coefficients across models hold the same interpretation only when they're orthogonal. What does that mean? Also, how would you interpret a coefficient after you've averaged it across different models?
