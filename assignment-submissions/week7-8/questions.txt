1. Where does the Optimization Equation (9.9-9.11) come from?

2. Can you provide more detail, or a more intuitive explanation, about how C, the tuning parameter from Equation 9.15, and the
Bias-Variance tradeoff are related?

3. How exactly does including polynomial terms in Eqn. 9.16 cause a non-linear decision boundary to be formed?

4. Why and how does Eqn. 9.23 work correctly?

5. What is an implicit feature space?

6. What is an ROC Curve?

7. For one-versus-one and one-versus-all, what happens if there's a tie between two classes that a point could belong to?

8. Would it be theoretically possible to create or discover an over-arching way to quantify how accurate a method is based on data 
characteristics? Such as an equation or formula that would take as input the characteristics of the data you want to analyze, and
have it output an 'accuracy measure' for each method to determine which method should be used on a set of data?
