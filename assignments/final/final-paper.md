## Final assignment - Due before 9am on 12/13/19

### Part 1 - Report 2 

You have investigated a lot of methods this semester. After the first few topics, you wrote up a report that applied those topics to data of your choice. Since then, you have learned about Support Vector Machines and Tree-Based Methods. I would like you to explore these two techniques with your data as well. For each method, 

- Define a question of interest that could be addressed with the method of interest 
- Describe, in your words, the idea behind the classification (or regression) method you will be using. 
- Apply the method to your data. 
- Interpret your findings and address any concerns you have with assumptions associated with the method.  
- For SVMs, investigate at least two different Kernels and compare your results. For the tree-based methods, investigate bagging, RF, and boosting (optional for discrete response) and compare your results. 

Provide a conclusion discussing similarites and differences, and pros and cons of each method. 

### Part 2 - Letter of Learning 

Write a letter (max 2 pgs) describing what you have learned in STAT 490 this semester.  Please address content-related learning, and also research-related learning (i.e., tools you have either developed or honed for you to become a more independent learner.) Discuss how you will use this information moving forward in your career. Please end your letter with some feedback for me by addressing the following questions: What else would you have liked to cover? How else could I have supported you in your learning?
