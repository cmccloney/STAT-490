##  Week 1 assignments: _8/30/19 - 9/6/19_ 

- __Data__: Find at least one dataset to work with that does not come from the book's R package. 
- __Reading__: Read Chapters 1 and 2 in _ISL_
- __Assignment__: Create a new directory for "assignment-submissions" and a directory within that directory named "week1". Within "assignment-submissions/week1", create a `.Rmd` file for the `R` portion of this assignment (e.g., same structure as "assignments/week1/assignment1.md). For the `Python` portion you can just push up a commented script. Once you are finished with the assignment notify me that you have made your final commit. 

    1. Write out two research questions that could be addressed using your dataset(s).  
    
        a. A research question that could be addressed with _regression_. Create a plot similar to Figure 1.1 in _ISL_ to display the data relevant to your research question.  
        b. A research question that could be addressed with _classification_. Create a plot similar to Figure 1.2 in _ISL_ to display the data relevant to your research question. 
        
    2. The book disinguishes between _predition_ and _inference_, but I would argue that both are forms of _inference_ - one is predictive and one is explanatory. Explain, in your own words the difference between these two inferential objectives. 
    3. Discuss differences and similarities between _parameteric_ and _non-parametric_ approaches to estimating $\mathcal{f}$. 
    4. In your own words, explain the difference between _supervised_ and _unsupervised_ learning.
