##  Week 2: _9/9/19 - 9/13/19_ 

__Reading__: Begin reading Chapter 3 in _ISL_, get through as much as possible, and start working on the questions below. 
__Assignment__: Within "assignment-submissions/week1", create a `.Rmd` file for the `R` portion of this assignment (e.g., same structure as "assignments/week1/assignment1.md). For the `Python` portion you can just push up a commented script, but you don't have to re-write answers! Once you are finished, notify me that you have made your final commit. 


### Comments on assignment 1 

- Try to give a little bit of background on any dataset you present and provide a description of information in plots that you create - see #1 below
- Be sure to indent your code in your .Rmd file so that when it compiles it does not run off of the screen.
- Nice descriptions of the main concepts from the first couple of chapters. This week, I'd like you to think more about the bias-variance trade-off, which is adds another component to a lot of the comparisons you made among concepts from the first few chapters. 

### Assignment 2

1. Last week you found a few datasets to work with and you were asked to write out two potential research questions that could be addressed (using your dataset(s)) with techniques discussed in Chapters 1 and 2 of the text. Provide some background (in your own words) describing the data sets you chose. Re-create the plots that you made for HW 1 and provide a short description of what you see in each. 

2. Explain the bias-variance tradeoff to one of your peers (i.e., someone who has some statistics background). 

2. Conceptual problem #2 from text, Carefully explain the differences between the KNN classifier and the KNN regression models. 

4. Work through the R lab beginning on page 109 - try to use python for the same tasks. Is there anyting that you couldn't recreate? Try to apply a few of the tools you learned to one of your own datasets.
